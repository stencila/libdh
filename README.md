A library of [Stencila](http://stenci.la)-compatible functions for the Digital Humanities.


## Testing

The `tests` folder has test files for each function. To run these tests install the [pytest package](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) e.g. `pip install pytest` and then, in the top level folder, run:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
